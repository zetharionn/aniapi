# Overview

***

## Overview

[AniAPI](https://github.com/zetharionn/aniapi) is a **lightweight** API wrapper over other Anime Services APIs.

***

## For what?

[AniAPI](https://github.com/zetharionn/aniapi) is needed for conveniently sending requests to other APIs of Anime Services. This **speeds up development**, but **does not take up much space** in the final bundle.

***

## Origin

Initially, this library was created for [AniTrack](https://github.com/zetharionn/anitrack) in order to conveniently receive information from various APIs of other anime services. Later, I decided to transfer the library to an independent library so that everyone could use it and not be dependent on the [AniTrack](https://github.com/zetharionn/anitrack) API, but development is still carried out specifically for [AniTrack](https://github.com/zetharionn/anitrack), because this is my main project. Thanks for understanding!
